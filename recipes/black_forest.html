            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 can cherry pie filling</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>

            <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 175 degrees C.</li>
            <li>
                Mix together: cake mix, beaten eggs, almond extract, cherry pie
                filling and 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips. Stir until just
                combined. Pour batter into a greased 9x13 inch pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in a 175 degree C oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until a
                toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove cake
                from oven and let cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                To Make Glaze: Heat 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, butter or
                margarine, and milk in a saucepan over medium high heat. Once
                semisweet chocolate chips are melted and mixture is combined
                stir in confectioners' sugar.Cook chicken in the preheated oven
                until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about
                1 hour 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the
                bone should read 74 degrees C.

                cream and a cherry.
